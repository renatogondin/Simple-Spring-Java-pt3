This is Spring + MySQL and Maven project too. I created an annotation named "perfil" with the credentials "user" and "admin". When the user access the the Principal Java class, there is a log request, and then the user can try the method "inclui" at a service class. The method will only work if the application marking the method has the credential.
There is also a created annotation which will check if the marked method accept and "user", "admin", both or none.
I am also using AspectJ here.

The used Java classes can be checked in one of my repos called Simple-Spring-Java-pt2, and this is a social network for getting car rides.
