A Java Desktop App.This is Spring + MySQL and Maven project too. 
I created an annotation named "perfil" with the credentials "user" and "admin". When the user access the the Principal Java class, 
there is a log request, and then the user can try the method "inclui" at a service class. The method will only work if the application 
marking the method has the credential. 
There is also a created annotation which will check if the marked method accept and "user", "admin", both or none. I am also using AspectJ here.
